# Binary-Classification-Project
This project is an end-to-end machine learning project that deals with classification algorithms. In this project I load a dataset and analyze the loaded data, create multiple different transformed views of the data and evaluate a suite of algorithms on each, and finalize and present the results of a model for making predictions on new data. For this project, I utilized [Weka 3.8.6](https://waikato.github.io/weka-site/index.html).
