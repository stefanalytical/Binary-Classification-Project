# Binary-Classification-Project
This project is an end-to-end machine learning project that deals with classification algorithms utilizing [Weka 3.8.6](https://waikato.github.io/weka-site/index.html). The first portion of the project features the diabetes.arff dataset and the final portion features the heart.csv dataset. The diabetes.arff dataset contains Pima Indians onset of diabetes data. The heart.csv dataset is also a real life heart failure prediction dataset that contains attributes of patients who may or may not suffer from heart disease. All other files are different views of the original datasets.

## Project Goals

1.	Load the dataset.
2.	Analyze the dataset.
3.	Prepare views of the dataset.
4.	Evaluate algorithms.
5.	Finalize model and present results.
